# ReticulumNDK

ReticulumNDK is the C++ port of the Reticulum Network Stack, now tailored for the Android NDK environment. This project extends the robust, cryptography-based networking capabilities of the original Reticulum stack to Android devices. It's designed for creating secure, efficient, and adaptable local and wide-area networks using a variety of hardware platforms, excelling in conditions of high latency or low bandwidth.

## Key Features

- **Native C++ Performance:** Optimized for Android devices, leveraging the power of C++ with Android NDK.
- **Comprehensive Encryption:** Incorporates end-to-end encryption to safeguard communication across all network nodes.
- **Advanced Networking Capabilities:** Supports multi-hop transport with autoconfiguration and cryptographic security.
- **Privacy and Anonymity:** Features to maintain initiator anonymity and protect user identities.
- **Adaptable Network Design:** Suitable for a range of mediums including LoRa radios, serial lines, WiFi, and more.
- **Developer-Friendly API:** Simplified integration and usage in Android applications.
- **Efficient and Secure Communication:** Designed to minimize overhead and maximize security in network interactions.
